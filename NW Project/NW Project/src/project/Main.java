//It is a program to say the kind of car that you have
package project;
import java.util.Scanner;
//the four main java data types used in this program are boolean (true/false), int (numbers with no decimals),
//double (numbers with decimals), and Strings (an array of characters).
//Java operator precedence is how Java determines which operator to evaluate first.Parentheses,Multiplication and division,then addition and subtraction 
//Primitive types are the most basic data types available within the Java language. There are 8: boolean, byte, char, short, int, long, float and double. 
//inheritance in java is the ability to allow one class to inherit methods and fields of another class. it is useful because it allows you to not have to rewrite code that you would normally use a lot.
